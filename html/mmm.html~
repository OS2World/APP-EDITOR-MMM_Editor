<H1>Intro to MMM Editor</H1>

<HR>
MMM is a text editor
(now for PCs with 101+ key keyboard, but maybe later for Sun, Alpha, ...)
Versions for following operating systems are avialable:

<UL>
<LI>  DOS (WATCOM C++ compiler)
<LI>  OS2 (WATCOM C++ compiler)
<LI>  Linux console (GNU C++ compiler)
<LI>  Windows 95/NT console (Microsoft visual C++ compiler)
</UL>

<HR>
Features avialable:
<UL>
<LI> Fold support.
<LI> Regular expressions search.
<LI> Tunable keyboard layout.
<LI> Tunable codepage layout.
<LI> Tunable color set.
<LI> Macrocommands as a sequence of keystrokes.
<LI> Macrocommands as a programs (own language)
<LI> Long filenames (not 8.3 as in DOS).
<LI> Some hypertext features.
</UL>

<DT>
Not avialable text formatting, multiple fonts, printing and other
stuff you can find in text processors like MS-WORD ...
Also not avialable UnDo feature, but I'll add it later.

<HR>
For compiling editor under DOS, OS2, Linux you must enter mmm directory
and say
<DT> <TT>MAKE -f makefilename</TT> <DT>
where <TT>makefilename</TT> is
<UL>
<DT> <TT>makelnx</TT> - makefile for Linux
<DT> <TT>makedos</TT> - makefile for DOS
<DT> <TT>makeos2</TT> - makefile for OS2
</UL>

<DT>
For compiling editor under Windows95/NT you must create a project with
two targets: <TT>mmmw</TT> and <TT>mmm_cfg</TT>.
The sources for <TT>mmmw</TT> are:
<TT>mmmx.cpp, mmmtext.cpp, mmmgrep.cpp, mmm_nunx.cpp, mmm_w95.cpp</TT>
The source for <TT>mmm_cfg</TT> is <TT>mmm_cfg.cpp</TT>.

<DT>
After compiling you can use MMM, but the only function avialable without config
is <tt>ABORT</TT> (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Esc keystroke) - exiting from
editor without saving anything. To work normally you must create config
file <TT>mmm_base.cfg</TT> by <TT>mmm_cfg</TT> utility by typing
<TT>mmm_cfg configfile</TT>.

<DT>
Under DOS, OS2, Win OS-es editor looks for <TT>MMM</TT> environment variable and,
if this variable is defined, opens <TT>mmm_base.cfg</TT> file in
directory pointed by <TT>MMM</TT>.
    Example: <TT>mmm=c:\mim</TT>
    then config file is <TT>c:\mim\mmm_base.cfg</TT>
If variable is not defined,
then config file is in directory in which <TT>mm*.exe</TT> lies, for
example in <TT>C:\BIN</TT>
<DT>
Under Linux OS config file must be in user's home, for example in
<TT>/home/machulsk</TT> for user <TT>machulsk</TT>

<DT> mmm_cfg generates file with
<A HREF="mmmkbd.html">default keyboard layout</A> Now you're ready to
use MMM. But please read description of default keyboard layout carefully.

<HR>
<B>Note:</B> Under Linux, editor switches keyboard into RAW mode hence
you can't use MMM on X-terminal or through telnet. I think later
version with <TT>getc</TT> keyboard will be written.
Then editor will work on Suns, Alphas, Crays, ... everywhere. RULEZ.

Now I'm working on X11R4+ version of editor. Than you can compile,
tune and use it on every Unix with XFree.
But I don't know what about OpenWindows and other X-s.
Maybe their APIs has differences with XFree.

<HR>
<H3>Description of main concepts and HOWTO</H3>
<DT>
When run mmm editor, you can see usual text and cursor on it.
You can move cursor by pressing arrow buttons and type letters by
pressing usual buttons (letters and digits).
You can quit from mmm (Alt+UpArrow) or enter into another files (Ald+DownArrow).
Some lines of your text are white (usual lines) and some are yellow
(yellow lines are Folds). You can place cursor on yellow line
and press Ald+DownArrow to enter this Fold. There you can type
more text. You can insert new Fold in current position by
pressing Alt+Ins or delete current Fold/Line.
Fold concept helps you to structurize text of your program.

<DT>
<b>How to Search</b>
Press Ctrl+'*' (gray '*' but not white '*' above '8' digit),
and You'll find yourself in Search Page.
Then insert empty line, type expression you want to search and
press Ctrl+'*' one more time to return to your text.
Now You can search forward by pressing '*' or backward by pressing
Shift+'*'. If You want to search regular expressions (wildcars,
[],{}, ... as in VI) then you have to start your expression from
backslash with space after it.

<DT>
<b>How to Replace</b> Your search-expression must looks the foolowing way:
<tt>What to Find\ What To Substitute </tt> (backslash with space separates
two expressions) After that you can press Alt+'*' to replace.

<DT>
<b>How to Execute program from within MMM</b> type expression you want send to
command interpreter and press Shift+Esc on that line. If the
Line under cursor was Fold then all lines from that fold will be executed.

<DT>
<b>What is Block?</b> you can mark line by pressing Caps+UpArrow or
Caps+DownArrow on it, and so you can mark a lot of lines.
When later you type something in one of the marked lines, everything
you type will be written syncronous in every marked line.

<DT>
<B>How to enter into file with name</b> /<TT>my file with spaces in name</TT>/
<b>from within editor?</B> Type
      <DT> <TT>"my file with spaces in name"</TT> <DT>
put cursor on /<TT>my</TT>/ or /<TT>name</TT>/ word, press Alt+DownArrow and
you will find yourself in that file. If you place cursor on one of
the other words (<tt>spaces</TT> for example) then editor will open file
with short name (here: <tt>spaces</TT>).

<DT>
<B>What is in status line?</b>
    <li> number of current line in file. These numbers are preserved during
        editing the file (new lines have 0 number). This feature is
        useful for reading compiler diagnostics (ex: Watcom's .err files)
    <li> X-coordinate of cursor
    <li> Hex ASCII code of symol under cursor
    <li> SI/SS - search mode (insensetive/sensetive)
    <li> ins/ovr - typing mode (insert/overwrite)
    <li> AI/.. - autoindent mode
    <li> sacC/.... - modifiers mask (Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Caps)
    <li> Q/й/я/╒ - Current keyboard layout (qwerty / йцукенг / яверты / pseudographics)
    <li> filename
    <li> depth in file
    <li> number of pages open (min 2: File, ConstPage)
    <li> number of marked lines saved in buffer
    <li> current directory
